# Aman Singh — Backend Portfolio

Modern, dark-mode portfolio for Aman Singh, a backend engineer focused on Go, PHP, Python, MySQL, Redis, and distributed systems. Built with the latest Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Framer Motion. The entire site is statically generated (SSG) so it can be deployed to any static hosting provider or Vercel without a server runtime.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 16 (App Router, static export)
- TypeScript + strict mode
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Framer Motion for subtle reveal/fade animations
- `next/font` Geist family + custom CSS variables
- Content sourced from typed data files in `src/data`

## Local Development
1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:3000` to preview.
3. **Static production build + preview**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx serve out   # or any static file server
   ```

## Deploying to Vercel
1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Create a new Vercel project and import the repo.
3. Use the default build command `npm run build` and output directory `out/` (generated by `next export`).
4. No environment variables are required; the site is 100% static.
5. Redeploy whenever you edit the `src/data` files or components.

### Detailed Vercel Deployment Guide
| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Ensure you can build locally: 
pm install && npm run build. This generates the static files in /out. |
| 2 | Commit all changes and push to a Git provider (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket). Vercel reads the repository to build the site. |
| 3 | In the Vercel dashboard click **New Project → Import Git Repository**, select this repo, and continue. |
| 4 | On the configuration screen choose **Other / Static Site** so Vercel honors the included ercel.json (which uses @vercel/static-build and distDir: out). Leave the Build Command as 
pm run build and Output Directory as out. |
| 5 | Environment variables: none are required. Leave the list empty. |
| 6 | Click **Deploy**. Vercel installs dependencies, runs 
pm run build, and uploads the out/ directory as static assets. |
| 7 | After the first build, copy the generated .vercel.app URL or attach a custom domain under the **Domains** tab. |
| 8 | For subsequent deployments, push to main (or the branch you connected). Vercel automatically rebuilds. For previews, open a PR; Vercel creates per-branch preview URLs. |
| 9 | Optional CLI deploy: run 
pm install -g vercel, authenticate with ercel login, then run ercel --prod from the repo root. The CLI respects the same ercel.json file and uses the out/ export. |

### Troubleshooting
- **
outes-manifest.json missing:** This means Vercel tried to treat the project as a standard Next.js server build. Ensure your project is using the provided ercel.json (static build) by selecting **Other / Static Site** in the Vercel project settings before redeploying.

## Editing Content
All copy lives in a few small data files so you never have to dig through components:

| Content | File | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name, hero text, stats, contact info, stack, focus areas | `src/data/profile.ts` | Update `contact.resumeUrl`, `contact.gmailComposeUrl`, and `photo` metadata when swapping assets. |
| Navigation links (header + mobile) | `src/data/navigation.ts` | Add/remove entries to expose new sections or external URLs. |
| Experience timeline bullets | `src/data/experience.ts` | Each `achievement` is icon + metric copy. |
| Project cards & case-study details | `src/data/projects.ts` | Add new entries; slugs power future dynamic routes. |
| React Bits spotlight cards | `src/data/reactBits.ts` | Powers the interactive showcase that mimics React Bits spotlight UI. |
| Skill groups / badges | `src/data/skills.ts` | Group labels double as section headers. |
| Education & certifications | `src/data/education.ts` | Add more degrees or credentials as needed. |

After editing data, rerun `npm run dev` (or refresh) to see updates instantly.

## Customizing & Adding Features
- **Hero CTA + Resume:** Replace the PDF at `public/amansingh.pdf` and set `profile.contact.resumeUrl` (and `profile.contact.gmailComposeUrl` if you prefer a different compose provider). The CTA opens in a new tab.
- **Profile photo:** Swap `public/profile-photo.jpeg` with your image and adjust `profile.photo` (src + alt text). The hero uses `next/image` so larger files are optimized automatically.
- **Stats with counters:** Each stat in `profile.stats` accepts `numericValue`, `prefix`, `suffix`, and `decimals`. Add entries to animate more KPIs via the shared `AnimatedNumber` component.
- **React Bits spotlight:** Edit `src/data/reactBits.ts` to change the interactive cards or add more. The spotlight hover effect automatically adapts to new entries.
- **Navigation:** Update `src/data/navigation.ts` to add items that point to new sections, external case studies, or a blog. External links open in a new tab automatically.
- **Sections:** Home sections are regular React components. Drop in new sections inside `src/app/page.tsx` and source copy from new data files (e.g., `src/data/testimonials.ts`).
- **Projects page:** The filter chips auto-populate from each project's `stack` array. Adding a new tag automatically becomes selectable.
- **Animations:** `Reveal` and `AnimatedNumber` handle framer-motion effects. Duplicate these patterns for other components to keep motion consistent.

## Future Improvements
1. Add an “Engineering Notes” or blog section sourced from MDX for long-form breakdowns.
2. Create detailed `/projects/[slug]` case-study pages with architecture diagrams and runbooks.
3. Ship a dark/light theme toggle that persists the user’s preference via cookies or `localStorage`.
4. Wire up lightweight analytics (Vercel Analytics or Tinybird) for page insights.
5. Embed a small playground demonstrating a streaming API or WebSocket snippet with live metrics.
